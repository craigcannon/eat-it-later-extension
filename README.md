how this works:  
1. install the extension. [how to get the code](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/). [how to install an extension](http://www.howtogeek.com/233355/how-to-install-extensions-from-outside-the-chrome-web-store-and-firefox-add-ons-gallery/).  
2. go to amazon and save snacks.  
3. snackes are saved to a g doc [that lives here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wFgtTJwhg7H5C6XHeDnDAcaMEHrkG8kfHdXLWKcgwvk/edit#gid=1730317601).
